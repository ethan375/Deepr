# Title of our project

## **User story**
1. When the user loads the home page they will be able to login or sign up.
2. After the user logs in they will be able to see the topics they have permissions to
3. The user will enter their appropriate conversation topic and make new posts
4. Post will be able to be up and down voted by users
5. When a post by a user reaches a preset milestone of upvotes they will have access to the 'higher' aspects of the conversation


## **Why Did we build this?**
We built this app to grow a community that values intellectual conversation.

## What problem does this solve?
The problem with a site such as reddit is anyone can post anything they want. So if a group of people are trying to have a conversation a "troll" can come in and post whatever they want to intentionally mess with people. This app is an attempt at fixing this problem. The trolls will be left at the lowest level of the conversation unable to advance.

This app also creates an online community accessible by anyone to talk about subject they might otherwise not be able to with the people around them in real life.



## **Approach**
This app allows users to join a community of people interested in the same topic. The site will be "monitored" by its users so that only people who are really interested can take part in the conversation. Based on how many up votes a user's post has will determine if they will be allowed to move on to the "higher levels". In the higher levels of the conversation there will be subtopics.
